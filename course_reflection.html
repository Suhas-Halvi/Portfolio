        <h2>Before the Course</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the semester, I saw algorithms mainly as pieces of code that solve problems, 
          without thinking deeply about how efficient they are. I was comfortable with basic data 
          structures like arrays, stacks, and queues, but I was not very confident about complexity 
          analysis, proofs, or mathematical reasoning behind algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expected the course to be challenging, especially topics involving recursion, 
          recurrence relations, and abstract concepts such as complexity classes. At the same time, 
          I hoped that this subject would give me a strong foundation for coding rounds, technical 
          interviews, and future computer science courses.

    <!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>

      <h3>Algorithm Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        I learned how to measure the performance of algorithms using time and space complexity. 
        Concepts like best, worst, and average case analysis, as well as notations such as Big-O, 
        Big-Theta, and Big-Omega, helped me compare algorithms beyond just “it works” and focus 
        on how they scale with input size.
      </p>

      <h3>Design Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        The course introduced different ways to design algorithms for a problem. 
        With divide and conquer, I saw how breaking a problem into subproblems leads to efficient 
        solutions like merge sort and quick sort. Using greedy strategies, I solved problems such as 
        activity selection and minimum spanning trees, and I understood when local choices lead to 
        a globally optimal result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dynamic programming was one of the most impactful topics, where I learned to use overlapping 
        subproblems and optimal substructure. Problems like knapsack, longest increasing subsequence, 
        and matrix chain multiplication showed me how storing intermediate results can drastically 
        improve performance compared to naive recursion.
      </p>

      <h3>Complexity and Hard Problems</h3>
      <p>
        I was also introduced to complexity classes like P, NP, and NP-complete. 
        Understanding that some problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, currently have no 
        known polynomial-time algorithm made me realize why approximations and heuristics are necessary 
        in real-world applications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CHALLENGES + GROWTH -->
    <div class="grid-2">
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
        <p>
          In the beginning, I struggled to convert word problems into clear algorithmic steps. 
          I sometimes tried to memorize algorithms instead of understanding the idea behind them, 
          which made it hard to apply them in new situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Distinguishing when to use a greedy approach versus dynamic programming was also confusing. 
          Tracing recursion and solving recurrence relations took extra effort, and debugging logic 
          errors in longer algorithms was time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          To overcome these challenges, I started drawing recursion trees, dry-running my code on 
          small examples, and discussing doubts with friends and faculty. Practising extra questions 
          from online platforms gradually built my confidence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How I Grew</h2>
        <p>
          As the course progressed, my approach to problems became more structured. 
          I learned to first analyze constraints, decide on a suitable strategy, and only then begin 
          coding. This habit helped me write cleaner and more efficient solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My logical thinking and decomposition skills improved, and I became more comfortable 
          working under time limits in labs and tests. Presenting algorithm ideas to others and 
          explaining the reasoning behind them also strengthened my communication skills.
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>

    <!-- PROJECT REFLECTION -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Reflection on My Project</h2>
      <p>
        In the course project, I selected a problem that allowed me to apply the concepts learned 
        in class. While designing the solution, I had to carefully choose the right data structures 
        and algorithmic techniques, and I analysed the time and space complexity of my approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementing the project taught me how theoretical concepts such as greedy strategies, 
        dynamic programming, or graph algorithms translate into real code. I also learned the 
        importance of testing with different input sizes and edge cases to verify both correctness 
        and efficiency. If I redo the project in the future, I would like to experiment with 
        alternative algorithms and further optimize the performance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FUTURE PLANS -->
    <section class="card" style="margin-top:30px;">
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        This course has given me a strong foundation in designing and analysing algorithms, which is 
        essential for software development and coding interviews. I plan to continue practising 
        problems on online judges and revising important patterns such as recursion, dynamic 
        programming, and graph algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future projects, I want to apply these ideas to build efficient and scalable applications. 
        My goal is to keep improving my problem-solving skills so that I can perform well in technical 
        interviews and contribute effectively to real-world software systems.
